    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 03, 2026</p>

    <p>Thank you for using <strong>FitHeroRPG</strong> ("we", "us", or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p><strong>FitHeroRPG is an offline-first application.</strong> We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal data on any external servers. All data generated by the application is stored locally on your device.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Workout History:</strong> Your exercise logs (dates, repetitions, types) are stored in a local database (SQLite) on your phone.</li>
        <li><strong>Body Metrics:</strong> Your weight and height settings are stored in the app's local preferences (SharedPreferences) solely to calculate estimated calories burned.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Permissions and Sensors</h2>
    <p>To function correctly, the application requires access to specific hardware sensors on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Proximity Sensor:</strong> Used exclusively to detect push-ups when the device is placed on the floor. No data from this sensor is recorded or shared.</li>
        <li><strong>Accelerometer:</strong> Used to detect squat movements. The raw sensor data is processed in real-time to count repetitions and is not saved permanently.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect your data, we do not share, sell, or transfer your personal information to third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Rights (Data Deletion)</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your data. You can delete your entire workout history and personal settings at any time by using the <strong>"Reset History & Data"</strong> button located in the app's Settings menu. Uninstalling the application will also permanently remove all local data.</p>

    <h2>5. Medical Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>MFitHeroRPG is a tool for tracking physical activity and provides estimated calorie burn data. It is not a medical device. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional before beginning any new diet or exercise program.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Ideally, you should check this page periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
